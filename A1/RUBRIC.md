This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeTask 1
This task is to prepare the provided data for analysis.

You will start by processing the set of raw CSV files to extract the required information (using appropriate pandas functions).

Then, you need to clean the data by using the knowledge learnt in the lectures. You need to deal with all the potential issues/errors in the data appropriately and then write the cleaned data into a comma-separated values (csv) file

HIGH DISTINCTION
For the given scenario in the assignment, the solution can prepare the data completely free from errors, the data is in a form that is entirely appropriate for exploration.
4 to >3.5 pts

CREDIT
For the given scenario in the assignment, the prepared data has few errors and is in a form that is somewhat appropriate for exploration

Explore 3 columns, 1 column with nominal values, 1 column with ordinal values, and 1 column with numerical values. Create a graph for visualization for each column. Give a short explanation for each.
1.5 to >1.2 pts
HIGH DISTINCTION
The analyses is complete, and descriptive statistics and/or graphs used are entirely appropriate and reflect the required analyses. Graphs used are visualisation graphs, which are correctly formatted with all the necessary elements. Explanations are clear.
1.2 to >1.05 pts
DISTINCTION
The analyses is largely complete, and the descriptive statistics and/or graphs used are mostly appropriate and reflect the analyses. Graphs used are visualisation graphs, which are mostly formatted with all the necessary elements. Explanations are mostly clear.
1.05 to >0.7 pts
CREDIT
The analyses is incomplete, and the descriptive statistics and/or graphs used are somewhat appropriate and reflect the analyses. Graphs used are visualisation graphs, which are formatted in some way. Explanations are readable.
0.7 to >0 pts
Fail
The analyses is incomplete and contains many errors, and the descriptive statistics and/or graphs used are inappropriate and don't reflect the analyses. Graphs used are visualisation graphs, which are not formatted. Explanations are not clear or not given.

This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeTask 2.2
Choose 3 pairs of columns based on some plausible hypotheses, explore their relationships. Give a short description for each hypothesis.

(Note: in Rubric, this task corresponds to the coding part in your python code)
2 to >1.6 pts
HIGH DISTINCTION
Descriptive statistics and/or graphs used are entirely appropriate and reflect the analyses for all required columns. Graphs used are visualisation graphs, which are correctly formatted with all the necessary elements. Hypotheses for each pair of data explored is concisely, clearly stated. Discussion of interesting relationships (or lack of relationships) between pairs of attributes is clear, comprehensive and insightful.
1.6 to >1.2 pts
DISTINCTION
Descriptive statistics and/or graphs used are largely appropriate and reflect the analyses for all required columns. Graphs used are visualisation graphs, which are correctly formatted with almost all of the necessary elements. Hypotheses for almost all pairs of data explored is concisely & clearly stated. Discussion of interesting relationships (or lack of relationships) between pairs of attributes is clear & fairly comprehensive.
1.2 to >0.9 pts
PASS
Descriptive statistics and/or graphs used are appropriate and reflect the analyses for all required columns. Graphs used are visualisation graphs, which are correctly formatted with many of the necessary elements. Hypotheses for many pairs of data explored is sufficiently concise, sufficiently clear and fairly plausible. Discussion of interesting relationships (or lack of relationships) between pairs of attributes is somewhat clear and mostly complete.
0.9 to >0 pts
Fail
Descriptive statistics and/or graphs used are inappropriate, incorrect and/or missing important considerations. There might be analyses missing, incomplete or erroneous. Graphs used may not be visualisation graphs. There will be missing elements or significant mistakes with the formatting of the elements, which mar the clarity of communication. Hypotheses for a few pairs might be missing, lacking in clarity or erroneous. Discussion of interesting relationships (or lack of relationships) between pairs of attributes is missing, lacking in clarity or erroneous.

5 to >4.0 pts
HIGH DISTINCTION
For the given scenario in the assignment, the solution can identify whether there are the missing values and/or outliers, discuss their impact on the given data, and can reasonably replace (or remove) them if there are any. The analyses is complete, and descriptive statistics and/or graphs used are entirely appropriate and reflect the required analyses.

This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeTask 4
This task is to retrieve data from an external source and prepare the data for analysis.

You will start by retrieving the set of raw data files, load and extract the required information.

Then, you need to merge and clean the data by using the knowledge learnt in the lectures. You need to deal with all the potential issues/errors in the merged data file appropriately and then write the cleaned data into a comma-separated values (csv) file
