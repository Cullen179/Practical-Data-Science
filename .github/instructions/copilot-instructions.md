## Operational Context

When editing or creating notebooks, always edit and generate cells one by one. You should also run cells often to verify correctness.

When editing notebook cells or creating a new Jupyter notebook, do not create large cells. Each cell in a notebook should do one thing well.

When trying to interact with the notebook, you should avoid using terminal tools. Always try to see if the interaction can be done inside the notebook itself.

When faced with import errors, first check if there is an existing cell that imports the module in question.
